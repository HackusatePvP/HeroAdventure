# Hero Adventure
This isn't a game by any means. This is the project I use to test different features of RenJava. 
If you want an idea of how some of the api works feel free to use this project as a guide.

## Setup
* Run `mvn clean install`
* Download and run [RSDK](https://github.com/HackusatePvP/RenJavaSDK). I recommend using the following commands `--noclean --color blue`.
